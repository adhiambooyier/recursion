    Your job is to paint a row of n houses red, green, or blue
    so as to minimize total cost, where cost(i, color) = cost to pain house i the specified color.
    You may not paint two adjacent houses the same color. Write a program
    to determine an optimal solution to the problem. Hint : Use bottom-up dynamic
    programming and solve the following subproblems for each i = 1, 2, ..., n:
    • red(i)                     = min cost to paint houses 1, 2, ..., i so that the house i is red
    • green(i) = min cost to paint houses 1, 2, ..., i so that the house i is green
    • blue(i)     = min cost to paint houses 1, 2, ..., i so that the house i is blue
